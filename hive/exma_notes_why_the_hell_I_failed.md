notes:

1. Impala supported query with specific columns: save as orc?

2. Save your data eaay to query by day, and month: partition keys?

3. string manipulation in hive: replace a string, clean up a field

4. sqoop import: please type rather than copy paste.

5. stored for a long time and compability required: avro?

6. convert DF to rdd: why the heal is it not working as expected?
val df = sqlContext.sql("select * from customers")
val rdd = df.rdd \\the data has a brace

7. regex: when fields are seperated with comma, and a field contains comma itself. How to separate them with tab

8. fast internet connection and fluent work under linux environment

9. fastest compression and decompression algorithm: Snappy
highest compression rate: Gzip

10. use hive when dealing with tables, because sparks are really slow
check the source schema and target requirement before continuing

11. store binary record to hadoop (save-as-sequence? or what)

12. be really familiar with data import and export
